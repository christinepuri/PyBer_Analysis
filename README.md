# PyBer Ride-Sharing Analysis 
## Project Overview 
Create a summary of ride-sharing data for Pyber, which includes insight on numbers of rides, drivers and fares for each city type. Identify the differences in ride-sharing data between the different city types.

## Results 
The analysis shows that Urban cities have the largest number of rides, drivers, and highest fares, followed by the suburban then the rural. The average fare per ride is most expensive in rural cities, followed by suburban then urban cities. Likewise, the average fare per driver is highest in rural cities, followed by suburban cities, then urban cities.

## Summary and recommendations 
The analysis shows that there is a huge disparity amongst the number of drivers and rides between Urban, suburban, and rural cities, with Urban cities having the most drivers and rides, and thus the highest total fares, and lowest average fare per ride. 
Pyber should create incentives or programs that would increase the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities. Perhaps more advertisment of the ride-sharing service is needed in those cities. 
The average fare per ride in rural cities is about $10 more expensive than in urban cities, and $4 more expensive than in suburban cities. Pyber could offer deals such as discounts on a second ride, in order to encourage people to use the service more and increase the number of rides and fares in rural cities.
